## Project Description ##
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private. The algorithm is based on the fact that finding the factors of a large composite number is difficult: when the factors are prime numbers, the problem is called prime factorization. It is also a key pair (public and private key) generator.

##Discrete Math Concepts Used ##
Cryptography cipher 
Number theory	

###Example 1: Replace with Your Own###
#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int p = 3;
	int q = 11;
	int n = q * p;

##Problems Faced##
We was faced lockdown problem and also we got very late news about project.

###Problem 1: I don't know how to Code##
In discrete mathematics we face very problem in learning because this course is combination of many courses we study.The algorithms are 
different and very old.   

###Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree##
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.
